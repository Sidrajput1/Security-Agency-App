                    Traditional methodology of putting up guards everywhere and anywhere should be giving way to more unobtrusive and efficient vigilance. One very effective option is to adopt a system of positioning marshals at vital points that should preferably operate out of uniform and from locations which may give them better area scanning construction and ease of reaction, when required. They should be well educated with higher I.Q so that they can ‘own the environment’ and act independently, in keeping with the situation. They should be trained in marshal arts so that they could successfully ward off difficult situations. However a fine combination of aggression with coolness can be exercised. This concept will enhance the level of confidence the client will have in his security provider.
